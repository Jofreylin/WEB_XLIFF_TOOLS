# XLF XLIFF TOOLS

## Description
XLIFF Tools is a web application designed to simplify the translation process of XLF and XLIFF files, which are commonly used for app internalization.

This application serves as an example of how to implement external services to translate internalization files. It uses third-party libraries to handle the reading and translation of XML files.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular 18.0.4**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.7**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **FontAwesome Free 6**: A popular icon set and toolkit.

## Important Third-Party Packages
- **xml-js**: Converts XML to JSON and vice versa, making it easier to manipulate XML data in JavaScript.
- **open-google-translator**: A package to translate text using Google Translator's API.
- **ngx-spinner**: A library for showing loading spinners in Angular applications.

## Disclaimer
