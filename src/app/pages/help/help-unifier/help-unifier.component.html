        <p>
            This functionality allows you to upload and process two XLIFF files. The first file, referred to as the "Source File", should contain both 
            <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> elements, while the second file, referred to as the "Target File", should contain 
            <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements but potentially empty <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> elements. The script reads both files and compares the 
            <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements as complete objects. If a match is found between the <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements of the Source File and the Target File, the 
            corresponding <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> element from the Source File is copied into the Target File. This process ensures that the translations (targets) are 
            transferred accurately from one file to another based on the matching sources. The resulting content of the Target File, with the updated 
            <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> elements, is displayed for review. Additionally, there are options to clear the input fields and process the files again if needed.
